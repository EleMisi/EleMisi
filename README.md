### Hi, I'm Eleonora (she/her)  👋

I’m an AI Engineer with a Ph.D. in Computer Science, passionate about building robust AI systems from research to production. My expertise lies in Large Language Models (LLMs), knowledge-driven AI, and applied machine learning for real-world impact.

Currently, at Musixmatch, I’m leading the development of production AI systems by seamlessly integrating LLM-based components and custom SDKs. I focus on transforming research problems into production-ready solutions, owning end-to-end architecture (UI, data, inference), and collaborating closely with domain experts on cross-functional projects.

### 💡 My Approach to AI Engineering

As a former scout, I live by the motto: "There's no such thing as bad weather, only unsuitable clothing." I believe this mindset is crucial in AI: success hinges on robust preparation, adapting to challenges, and ensuring we have the right tools and strategies to tackle complex problems. This guides my focus on building resilient and adaptable systems.
